### The River

If at least two players remain playing the hand, DEALER deals 1 card facedown followed by 1 community card faceup, hereinafter referred to as THE-RIVER.

This is the last card dealt in this hand by the DEALER. 

The betting round is identical to THE-TURN.

1. The player who bet on the river is the default first player to reveal their hand.
2. If no betting happened, the player closest to the left of the dealer must show their hand first, continuing clockwise around the table.
3. PLAYER holding a losing hand can choose not to reveal their cards and concede the pot.
