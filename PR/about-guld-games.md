# About Guld Games

Guld Games (`gg`) is a group of competitive gamers who track their results on the GG ledger. Starting with in-person games, like friends playing Texas Hold'em, GG will add more games and play options, including automated, provably-fair options.

**On May 4, 2018, Guld Games introduced a Google Chrome extension.** Currently, the extension allows players to play Lottery, a peer-to-peer, provably-fair guessing game with variable odds and wagers.

## Important Notes on Guld Games

Members may wager on games, and/or create in-games payments. All of these payments must be made in the GG token to qualify for tracking in the `gg` group. At any point, Guld Games group members may burn GULD to acquire GG, or one player can send GG to another via a transfer.

All parties place their stakes in escrow, released to the winning party at game's end). also an overview of lottery (guess a number between 0 and MAX, winning guesses get paid out BET * MAX).

**GG is strictly peer-to-peer.** In Guld Games, there is no "house". Games take place between players (in the case of Lottery, these are the *dealer* and the *player*), and in every game, the total number of GG tokens put in by both players is *exactly equal* in all cases to the total number of GG tokens paid out.
